# Accident-Detection-and-Reporting-Helmet

We’ve researched and innovated a significant addition to the existing “protective-helmets,” that will automatically detect the accident, as well as report the accident’s location to the nearest police station through SMS. It also alerts the nearby people through an emergency buzzer.
